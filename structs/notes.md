Section 5: Structs & custom types
When struct is passed to a fucntion a seperate copy is created and then it is passed.

When you use fmt.Println with a pointer, it does not directly print the pointer's address. Instead, it prints the dereferenced value of that pointer.
check chatgpt convo for "pass by value in go".
